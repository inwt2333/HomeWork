You are participating in *MLE-bench*, an offline version of Kaggle competitions adapted to test the coding ability of agents like yourself.

You will be given a machine learning task. You must solve the task by training a model and running the model on the test set to produce a submission file. You may not hand-label the data to produce a submission file.

BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS
------
First, please read the instructions below which are specific to our benchmark setup. Note, these instructions can be found again in `instructions.txt`.

- **Competition-specific instructions**: The instructions for the competition are available in `input/description.md`. Read this file to understand the problem setup for the competition you are currently solving.
- **Dataset**: The dataset files for the competition are available in `input/`.
- **Submission**: We have simplified all competition types to use a simple CSV submission format. Regardless of what the competition instructions say, you MUST produce a submission file at `submission/submission.csv`. We will only evaluate submissions found at this path; failure to submit a `submission.csv` at this path will result in a failed attempt.
- **Test set**: In general, since we do not have access to the original test labels, we have constructed our own train/test split for each competition. As such, the dataset you see in `input/` may differ slightly from what is described in the competition instructions. Nevertheless the files available to you should otherwise be similar to the original and you should proceed with the competition task on the train/test splits available to you.
- **Submission checker**: We provide a tool for checking the validity of your submission file, in the form of a server endpoint at `http://localhost:5001/validate`. If you post a submission file to the server (e.g. `curl -X POST -F "file=@${SUBMISSION_FILE}" ${SERVER_URL}`), you will receive a response message telling you if your submission is valid or not (note that this does NOT give you a score). For your convenience, we provide a script `validate_submission.sh` which can help you make this submission to the validation server.
- **Cheating**: You are not allowed to view others' solutions to this competition. If we detect that your submission is plagiarized from others, the submission will be disqualified.

Your submission will be graded based on the metric in the competition-specific instructions. Your goal is to achieve the best score possible on the competition task. 

Wherever there is a conflict between the points above and the competition-specific instructions in `input/description.md`, the above points should always take priority since these are always true for our offline benchmark setup.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
------

- **Compute**: You have access to 1 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB with the appropriate drivers installed.
- **Total Runtime**: You have a maximum of 12hours 0mins 0secs hours to attempt this task. You may iteratively develop your solution within this time frame, but bear in mind that program runtime also counts towards this limit.
- **Total Steps**: You have a maximum of 500 steps to submit your solution.
- You will be informed of the remaining time and steps at each step.
- **Use as much of the available time as possible to refine and optimize your submission**: Your goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like validating your answer using the "Validate Submission" tool at the http://localhost:5000/validate endpoint, manually spot-checking predictions, building custom validation sets and grading functions, and comparing different algorithms. You may keep working until the time limit expires -- as long as your best submission is stored at the designated location at the end of your run, it will be picked up for grading.

# Overview

## Overview

### Description

As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.

Existing methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. This suffers from being labor-intensive, low-supply and costly. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.

In this competition, we introduce a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.

Your task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.

# Data

## Dataset Description

Can you identify a problem with a cassava plant using a photo from a relatively inexpensive camera? This competition will challenge you to distinguish between several diseases that cause material harm to the food supply of many African countries. In some cases the main remedy is to burn the infected plants to prevent further spread, which can make a rapid automated turnaround quite useful to the farmers.

### Files

**[train/test]_images** the image files. The full set of test images will only be available to your notebook when it is submitted for scoring. Expect to see roughly 15,000 images in the test set.

**train.csv**

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the ID code for the disease.

**sample_submission.csv** A properly formatted sample submission, given the disclosed test set content.

- `image_id` the image file name.

- `label` the predicted ID code for the disease.

**[train/test]_tfrecords** the image files in tfrecord format.

**label_num_to_disease_map.json** The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.
