You are participating in *MLE-bench*, an offline version of Kaggle competitions adapted to test the coding ability of agents like yourself.

You will be given a machine learning task. You must solve the task by training a model and running the model on the test set to produce a submission file. You may not hand-label the data to produce a submission file.

BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS
------
First, please read the instructions below which are specific to our benchmark setup. Note, these instructions can be found again in `instructions.txt`.

- **Competition-specific instructions**: The instructions for the competition are available in `input/description.md`. Read this file to understand the problem setup for the competition you are currently solving.
- **Dataset**: The dataset files for the competition are available in `input/`.
- **Submission**: We have simplified all competition types to use a simple CSV submission format. Regardless of what the competition instructions say, you MUST produce a submission file at `submission/submission.csv`. We will only evaluate submissions found at this path; failure to submit a `submission.csv` at this path will result in a failed attempt.
- **Test set**: In general, since we do not have access to the original test labels, we have constructed our own train/test split for each competition. As such, the dataset you see in `input/` may differ slightly from what is described in the competition instructions. Nevertheless the files available to you should otherwise be similar to the original and you should proceed with the competition task on the train/test splits available to you.
- **Submission checker**: We provide a tool for checking the validity of your submission file, in the form of a server endpoint at `http://localhost:5001/validate`. If you post a submission file to the server (e.g. `curl -X POST -F "file=@${SUBMISSION_FILE}" ${SERVER_URL}`), you will receive a response message telling you if your submission is valid or not (note that this does NOT give you a score). For your convenience, we provide a script `validate_submission.sh` which can help you make this submission to the validation server.
- **Cheating**: You are not allowed to view others' solutions to this competition. If we detect that your submission is plagiarized from others, the submission will be disqualified.

Your submission will be graded based on the metric in the competition-specific instructions. Your goal is to achieve the best score possible on the competition task. 

Wherever there is a conflict between the points above and the competition-specific instructions in `input/description.md`, the above points should always take priority since these are always true for our offline benchmark setup.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
------

- **Compute**: You have access to 1 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB with the appropriate drivers installed.
- **Total Runtime**: You have a maximum of 12hours 0mins 0secs hours to attempt this task. You may iteratively develop your solution within this time frame, but bear in mind that program runtime also counts towards this limit.
- **Total Steps**: You have a maximum of 500 steps to submit your solution.
- You will be informed of the remaining time and steps at each step.
- **Use as much of the available time as possible to refine and optimize your submission**: Your goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like validating your answer using the "Validate Submission" tool at the http://localhost:5000/validate endpoint, manually spot-checking predictions, building custom validation sets and grading functions, and comparing different algorithms. You may keep working until the time limit expires -- as long as your best submission is stored at the designated location at the end of your run, it will be picked up for grading.

# Overview

## Description

![Cdiscount](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/kaggle/3333/media/Cdiscount.png)

[Rules Update:](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdiscount-image-classification-challenge/rules) The CDiscount team has updated their rules to allow for use of this dataset for research and academic purposes only. To access the data, go to rules and accept the terms to download the data.

[Cdiscount.com](https://www.cdiscount.com/) generated nearly 3 billion euros last year, making it France’s largest non-food e-commerce company. While the company already sells everything from TVs to trampolines, the list of products is still rapidly growing. By the end of this year, Cdiscount.com will have over 30 million products up for sale. This is up from 10 million products only 2 years ago. Ensuring that so many products are well classified is a challenging task.

Currently, Cdiscount.com applies machine learning algorithms to the text description of the products in order to automatically predict their category. As these methods now seem close to their maximum potential, Cdiscount.com believes that the next quantitative improvement will be driven by the application of data science techniques to images.

In this challenge you will be building a model that automatically classifies the products based on their images. As a quick tour of Cdiscount.com's website can confirm, one product can have one or several images. The data set Cdiscount.com is making available is unique and characterized by superlative numbers in several ways:

- Almost 9 million products: half of the current catalogue
- More than 15 million images at 180x180 resolution
- More than 5000 categories: yes this is quite an extreme multi-class classification!

## Evaluation

### Goal

The goal of this competition is to predict the category of a product based on its image(s). Note that a product can have one or several images associated. For every product*_id* in the test set, you should predict the correct *category_id*.

### Metric

This competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of products you get correct).

### Submission File

For each *_id* in the test set, you must predict a *category_id*. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
_id,category_id
2,1000000055
5,1000016018
6,1000016055
etc.
```

## Prizes

- 1st place - $20,000
- 2nd place - $10,000
- 3rd place - $5,000

## Timeline

- **December 7, 2017** - Entry deadline. You must accept the competition rules before this date in order to compete.
- **December 7, 2017** - Team Merger deadline. This is the last day participants may join or merge teams.
- **December 14, 2017** - Final submission deadline.

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.

## About Cdiscount

![Cdiscount](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/kaggle/3333/media/Cdiscount.png)

[Cdiscount.com](https://www.cdiscount.com/), a subsidiary company of the Casino Group, is a major online retailer in France. The company has reported outstanding growth and generated a business volume of nearly 3 billion euros in 2016 supported by a constantly growing Marketplace, with products sold by more than 9,000 partnering merchants.

Focusing on four core values: proximity, audacity, engagement and reliability, Cdiscount.com strives to make everyday products and services affordable to everyone, while working hard to better understand and serve the customers’ needs.

One way to reach these goals is to develop the offer. Cdiscount.com's product catalog is growing rapidly and should reach more than 30 million items by the end of the year. In order to support this development and allow clients to browse intuitively through such a large range of products, it is important that each item is well-classified.

Therefore, Cdiscount.com believes that data science is the way forward to automatically select the best category for each new product and improve the shopping experience.

### Key figures

# Data

## Dataset Description

### Update:

At the request of the sponsor, the data has been removed post-competition.

### BSON Files

[BSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON), short for Bin­ary JSON, is a bin­ary-en­coded seri­al­iz­a­tion of JSON-like doc­u­ments, used with [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB). [This kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/inversion/processing-bson-files) shows how to read and process the BSON files for this competition.

### File Descriptions

**Please Note:** The train and test files are very large!

- **train.bson** - (Size: 58.2 GB) Contains a list of 7,069,896 dictionaries, one per product. Each dictionary contains a product id (key: _id), the category id of the product (key: category_id), and between 1-4 images, stored in a list (key: imgs). Each image list contains a single dictionary per image, which uses the format: {'picture': b'…binary string…'}. The binary string corresponds to a binary representation of the image in JPEG format. [This kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/inversion/processing-bson-files) provides an example of how to process the data.
- **train_example.bson** - Contains the first 100 records of train.bson so you can start exploring the data before downloading the entire set.
- **test.bson** - (Size: 14.5 GB) Contains a list of 1,768,182 products in the same format as train.bson, except there is no category_id included. The objective of the competition is to predict the correct category_id from the picture(s) of each product id (_id). The category_ids that are present in Private Test split are also all present in the Public Test split.
- **category_names.csv** - Shows the hierarchy of product classification. Each category_id has a corresponding level1, level2, and level3 name, in French. The category_id corresponds to the category tree down to its lowest level. This hierarchical data may be useful, but it is not necessary for building models and making predictions. All the absolutely necessary information is found in train.bson.
- **sample_submission.csv** - Shows the correct format for submission. It is highly recommended that you zip your submission file before uploading for scoring.
