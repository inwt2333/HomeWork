You are participating in *MLE-bench*, an offline version of Kaggle competitions adapted to test the coding ability of agents like yourself.

You will be given a machine learning task. You must solve the task by training a model and running the model on the test set to produce a submission file. You may not hand-label the data to produce a submission file.

BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS
------
First, please read the instructions below which are specific to our benchmark setup. Note, these instructions can be found again in `instructions.txt`.

- **Competition-specific instructions**: The instructions for the competition are available in `input/description.md`. Read this file to understand the problem setup for the competition you are currently solving.
- **Dataset**: The dataset files for the competition are available in `input/`.
- **Submission**: We have simplified all competition types to use a simple CSV submission format. Regardless of what the competition instructions say, you MUST produce a submission file at `submission/submission.csv`. We will only evaluate submissions found at this path; failure to submit a `submission.csv` at this path will result in a failed attempt.
- **Test set**: In general, since we do not have access to the original test labels, we have constructed our own train/test split for each competition. As such, the dataset you see in `input/` may differ slightly from what is described in the competition instructions. Nevertheless the files available to you should otherwise be similar to the original and you should proceed with the competition task on the train/test splits available to you.
- **Submission checker**: We provide a tool for checking the validity of your submission file, in the form of a server endpoint at `http://localhost:5001/validate`. If you post a submission file to the server (e.g. `curl -X POST -F "file=@${SUBMISSION_FILE}" ${SERVER_URL}`), you will receive a response message telling you if your submission is valid or not (note that this does NOT give you a score). For your convenience, we provide a script `validate_submission.sh` which can help you make this submission to the validation server.
- **Cheating**: You are not allowed to view others' solutions to this competition. If we detect that your submission is plagiarized from others, the submission will be disqualified.

Your submission will be graded based on the metric in the competition-specific instructions. Your goal is to achieve the best score possible on the competition task. 

Wherever there is a conflict between the points above and the competition-specific instructions in `input/description.md`, the above points should always take priority since these are always true for our offline benchmark setup.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
------

- **Compute**: You have access to 1 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB with the appropriate drivers installed.
- **Total Runtime**: You have a maximum of 12hours 0mins 0secs hours to attempt this task. You may iteratively develop your solution within this time frame, but bear in mind that program runtime also counts towards this limit.
- **Total Steps**: You have a maximum of 500 steps to submit your solution.
- You will be informed of the remaining time and steps at each step.
- **Use as much of the available time as possible to refine and optimize your submission**: Your goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like validating your answer using the "Validate Submission" tool at the http://localhost:5000/validate endpoint, manually spot-checking predictions, building custom validation sets and grading functions, and comparing different algorithms. You may keep working until the time limit expires -- as long as your best submission is stored at the designated location at the end of your run, it will be picked up for grading.

# Overview

## Description

[H&M Group](https://www.hmgroup.com/) is a family of brands and businesses with 53 online markets and approximately 4,850 stores. Our online store offers shoppers an extensive selection of products to browse through. But with too many choices, customers might not quickly find what interests them or what they are looking for, and ultimately, they might not make a purchase. To enhance the shopping experience, product recommendations are key. More importantly, helping customers make the right choices also has a positive implications for sustainability, as it reduces returns, and thereby minimizes emissions from transportation.

In this competition, H&M Group invites you to develop product recommendations based on data from previous transactions, as well as from customer and product meta data. The available meta data spans from simple data, such as garment type and customer age, to text data from product descriptions, to image data from garment images.

There are no preconceptions on what information that may be useful – that is for you to find out. If you want to investigate a categorical data type algorithm, or dive into NLP and image processing deep learning, that is up to you.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 12 (MAP@12):

$$
\text{MAP@12}=\frac{1}{U} \sum_{u=1}^U \frac{1}{\min (m, 12)} \sum_{k=1}^{\min (n, 12)} P(k) \times \text{rel}(k)
$$

where $U$ is the number of customers, $P(k)$ is the precision at cutoff $k, n$ is the number predictions per customer, $m$ is the number of ground truth values per customer, and $\text{rel}(k)$ is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank $k$ is a relevant (correct) label, zero otherwise.

**Notes:**

- You will be making purchase predictions for all `customer_id` values provided, regardless of whether these customers made purchases in the training data.
- Customer that did not make any purchase during test period are excluded from the scoring.
- There is never a penalty for using the full 12 predictions for a customer that ordered fewer than 12 items; thus, it's advantageous to make 12 predictions for each customer.

### Submission File

For each `customer_id` observed in the training data, you may predict up to 12 labels for the `article_id`, which is the predicted items a customer will buy in the next 7-day period after the training time period. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
customer_id,prediction
00000dba,0706016001 0706016002 0372860001 ...
0000423b,0706016001 0706016002 0372860001 ...
...
```

# Data

## Dataset Description

For this challenge you are given the purchase history of customers across time, along with supporting metadata. Your challenge is to predict what articles each customer will purchase in the 7-day period immediately after the training data ends. Customer who did not make any purchase during that time are excluded from the scoring.

## Files

- **images/** - a folder of images corresponding to each `article_id`; images are placed in subfolders starting with the first three digits of the `article_id`; note, not all `article_id` values have a corresponding image.
- **articles.csv** - detailed metadata for each `article_id` available for purchase
- **customers.csv** - metadata for each `customer_id` in dataset
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
- **transactions_train.csv** - the training data, consisting of the purchases each customer for each date, as well as additional information. Duplicate rows correspond to multiple purchases of the same item. Your task is to predict the `article_id`s each customer will purchase during the 7-day period immediately after the training data period.

**NOTE:** You must make predictions for all `customer_id` values found in the sample submission. All customers who made purchases during the test period are scored, regardless of whether they had purchase history in the training data.
